Each proposal or other contribution should have an equal opportunity to be considered and advanved to the next round.  A webform and other actions (sliders, selectors, etc) can enable simulteneous proposal of ideas followed immediately be simulteneous rating of each idea by a statistically significant number and cross-section of the population. \r\n\r\n## ROUND ONE: WHAT\r\n**Ask: What do you want to be hacking?**\r\n  - pitch in *ideas*, with a **title**, a **blurb** and **success metrics** via a web form.\r\n  - submissions/references to submissions are *stored* in the contract along with the senders id/address.\r\n  - **Rate** the submissions\r\n  - authorized person *takes a call/decides* (the filter) - The selected idea is now a *candidate for the next round*\r\nOutput: The project summary as a README in the GitHub repo\r\n\r\n## ROUND TWO: HOW\r\n**Ask: How do we hack it?**\r\n  - **Rate** the submissions\r\n  - authorized person **takes a call**\r\nOutput: The Process. Details go into the README on GitHub\r\n\r\n## ROUND THREE: WHEN\r\n  - Ask *What key milestones* and *Dates* to hack this project?\r\n  - Automate the results to Milestones in GitHub, and include the \"Successfully Achieved Success Metric\" data as an Issue tied to a key project milestone.\r\n\r\n### MVP - 1 - features\r\n  - API to **register** participants\r\n  - API to **gather** WHATs - ideas{title, blurb}, success metrics[] in round 1 and HOWs - language, framework etc in round 2\r\n  - API to **rate** the entries that were gathered (ideas are distributed to the participants randomly) #TODO @dazzaji, more details?\r\n  - API to **sort** the entries based on the ratings\r\n  - API to **filter**, in this case access is granted only to the authorized person for the respective round\r\n  - **Decision** API that returns the final summary of the decisions made.\r\n\r\nNote: This will evolve :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
